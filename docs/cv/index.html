<li>Phone +356 99100291 (timezone is UTC+1)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I design, develop, maintain and run software systems with a focus on long-term
maintainability, and lead small teams doing so.</p>
<h2 id="software-design-development--operations">Software design, development &amp; operations</h2>
<p>In Ridge I produce software architecture, component design and supporting tools
and procedures. I also implement a quite a bit of the design.</p>
<p>In Luminati I have designed and implemented application-devel metrics and
logging system, providing visibility into the application behaviour, and
created an application-specific database system to eliminate the bottleneck
that could not be solved by off-the-shelf database.</p>
<p>In OpenInkpot I have designed and guided the effort to develop embedded
Linux distribution suited for eBook readers, from kernel up to custom
UI optimized for e-Ink screens.</p>
<p>Outside of commercial context I am a contributor to <a href="https://dottedmag.net/software/">numerous open source
projects</a>, including well-known ones such
as BusyBox, fontconfig, GNOME, Linux and VLC. Some of my code is present on
most Linux machines: if you&rsquo;re on desktop Linux, you might want to run
<code>man 1 unshare</code> and check <code>AUTHORS</code> section.</p>
<h2 id="technical-leadership">Technical leadership</h2>
<p>I know how to introduce, set up and fine tune processes of software development,
testing and deployment. In Ridge, CFEngine and OpenInkpot I have established
engineering processes of code review, continuous integration and unit- and
acceptance-testing.</p>
<h2 id="product-management">Product management</h2>
<p>In Ridge I define product requirements based on collected customers' needs
to make the product appealing to all roles in customers' organizations.</p>
<p>In OpenInkpot I defined the product scope, collected customers' needs and
translated them into product requirements.</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project management</h2>
<p>I have some experience managing small teams, especially volunteer-based: In OpenInkpot
I managed volunteer contributors and a distributed team to produce software for
Azbooka e-reader.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-expect">What do I expect?</h1>
<p>Remote work and a flexible work schedule, to a reasonable extent.</p>

<p>Senior software engineer.</p>
<p>I have improved insight into performance of Hola services by adding</p>
<ul>
<li>centralised application-level logging, and</li>
<li>application-level metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>that made it much easier to pinpoint and resolve performance problems and bugs.</p>
<p>I have created several internal-facing statistic dashboards for Hola VPN and
also user-facing statistics for Hola Spark CDN.</p>
<p>While working on Luminati I have implemented a custom in-memory DB to track the
status of 1M+ peers of Luminati network that decreased the price of hardware
running this database by 8x compared to the off-the-shelf DB.</p>
