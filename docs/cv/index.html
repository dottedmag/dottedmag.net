<li>Mikhail Gusarov</li>

<li>Phone +356 99100291 (timezone is UTC+1)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>I design, develop, maintain and run software systems with a focus on long-term
maintainability, and lead compact teams doing so.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-do">What do I do?</h1>
<h2 id="software-design">Software design</h2>
<p>Software systems need both functionality and properties such as flexibility,
adaptability and ease of operations. I know how to isolate layers, invert
dependencies, partition systems, evict state, add immutability, split interfaces
and make tons of other small and large decisions to make it happen.</p>
<p>Requirements change all the time. I know how to do an MVP to avoid spending
months implementing features nobody wants.</p>
<p>Complexity creeps in. I know how to prune unwanted statefulness, remove layering
violations, keep the interfaces minimal.</p>
<p>All software is distributed now: Web SPA and mobile apps are distributed systems
too. I know how to manage upgrades, do a staged rollout client- and server-side,
collect metrics and log messages, how to deal with old versions of client
software suddenly reappearing out of the blue and how to version REST protocols
to avoid breakages while staying flexible.</p>
<h2 id="distributed-team-leadership">(Distributed) team leadership</h2>
<p>I have experience leading compact engineering teams (from 2 to 8 people), both
on-site and distributed (with timezones spread from UTC-4 to UTC+8), both in
commercial setting and in a voluntary cooperation around an open source project.</p>
<p>I like this kind of work and would like to do it again, especially in an
environment where management and technical leadership are separate roles.</p>
<h2 id="reengineering-and-refactoring">Reengineering and refactoring</h2>
<p>Is your legacy system a mess? Does implementing a new feature take ages, do
bugfixes cause more problems than they solve, do system administrators have to
apply enormous amount of effort to keep it running?</p>
<p>This is something I am able to do and like to tackle. I have experience
decluttering various software systems, getting rid of creeping statefulness and
streamlining operations.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>I know my tools. I have introduced CI into several projects, bootstrapped an
embedded Linux distribution and all of its infrastructure, and wrote a countless
number of tests, makefiles and scripts.</p>
<h2 id="devops--sre">DevOps / SRE</h2>
<p>Server configuration management is so XX century (I&rsquo;m saying this as
<a href="https://github.com/cfengine/core/graphs/contributors">a major contributor to CFEngine</a>).</p>
<p>Read-only stateless containers are a good thing (I added a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/tree/AUTHORS#n71">container-related tool to util-linux</a>).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to work on a project that either plans to, switches, or uses existing
tools, such as Docker and Kubernetes. Implementing infrastructure bits and
pieces from scratch is a lot of fun and one can sink enormous amount of effort
on it.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-expect">What do I expect?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remote work (unless the company offices are located on Malta).</li>
<li>Flexible work schedule, to a reasonable extent.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="projectscompanies">Projects/Companies</h1>
<h2 id="open-sourcesoftware"><a href="/software">Open Source</a></h2>
<p>I have <a href="/software">contributed numerous patches</a> to various open source
projects, mostly fixing problems I have encountered.</p>
<p>Are you running Ubuntu or Debian? Say <code>apt-cache show libssh2-1</code> and see the
Maintainer field.</p>
<p>Are you running Linux? Check out the <code>AUTHOR</code> stanza in <code>man 1 unshare</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ridgehttpsridgeco-2018"><a href="https://ridge.co">Ridge</a> (2018+)</h2>
<p>I am a software architect of Ridge project.</p>
<p>I am responsible for eliciting and developing users' needs, formulating
requirements for Ridge, shaping the architecture to fulfill these needs.</p>
<p>I am also responsible for code reviews and for for improving project tooling.</p>
<h2 id="holahttpsholaorg--luminatihttpsluminatiio-2013-2018"><a href="https://hola.org">Hola!</a> / <a href="https://luminati.io">Luminati</a> (2013-2018)</h2>
<p>Wearing my SRE hat, I have improved insight into performance of Hola services,
by adding</p>
<ul>
<li>centralised application-level logging, and</li>
<li>application-level metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>that made it much easier to pinpoint and resolve performance problems and bugs.</p>
<p>I have created several internal-facing statistic dashboards for Hola VPN and
also user-facing statistics for Hola Spark CDN.</p>
<p>While working on Luminati I have implemented a custom in-memory DB to track the
status of 1M+ peers of Luminati network that decreased the price of hardware
running this database by 8x compared to the off-the-shelf DB.</p>
<h2 id="debianhttpsdebianorg-2006"><a href="https://debian.org/">Debian</a> (2006+)</h2>
<p>I maintain several packages in Debian, mostly &ldquo;scratching my own itch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My Debian experience usually makes me a &ldquo;resident Debian/Ubuntu expert&rdquo; in
companies I work for.</p>
<h2 id="cfenginehttpscfenginecom-2011-2013"><a href="https://cfengine.com">CFEngine</a> (2011-2013)</h2>
<p>I have thrust CFEngine from SunOS 4 times into 21 century (not single-handedly,
but pushing hard for the changes), converting it from R&amp;D-ware to a reliable
software package along the way, adding unit and system testing, continuous
integration, discernible release management and other useful software
engineering practices.</p>
<h2 id="openinkpothttpswikimobilereadcomwikiopeninkpot-2007-2012"><a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Openinkpot">OpenInkpot</a> (2007-2012)</h2>
<p>A Linux distribution for eBook readers. It was fun while it lasted until Kindle
killed it.</p>
<p>I have started it, have built the infrastructure (from bugtracking to
cross-compiling Debian packages in CI environment to repository manager) and was
BDFLing it until it withered out.</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;ve got the experience managing distributed team in addition to the
previous experince working in one.</p>
<h2 id="parallelshttpsparallelscom-2004-2007"><a href="https://parallels.com">Parallels</a> (2004-2007)</h2>
<p>For Plesk for Unix I have created (in a team) a tool for transferring contents
of competing hosting panels to Plesk, which was then repurposed as a backup
system.</p>
<p>OpenFusion project was my first spell as a software architect. I have designed
SSO mechanism for Parallels apps, and also
a <a href="http://www.apsstandard.org/">Web applications packaging format</a>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Packaging_Standard">Wikipedia page</a>).</p>
