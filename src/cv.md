## Professional Summary

I am a software engineer who specializes in the design, development,
maintenance, and operation software systems emphasizing long-term
maintainability. My experience includes leading small teams, and I
have demonstrated technical leadership and product management skills.
I am a contributor to various open-source projects, including
prominent ones like BusyBox, fontconfig, GNOME, Linux, and VLC.

I'm open to contract and full-time opportunities.

## Areas of Expertise

### Software design, Development & Operations

At Ridge, my responsibilities inlcude software architecture,
component design and the development of development tools
and procedures. Additionally, I have implemented a significant portion
of the system.

At Luminati, I designed and implemented an application-level metrics and
logging system to improve the visibility of application behavior. Moreover
I created a custom database system to address a performance bottleneck
that could not be resolved with off-the-shelf databases.

In the OpenInkpot project, I steered the development of an embedded
Linux distribution specifically designed for eBook readers, encompassing
everything from the kernel to a custom UI optimized for e-Ink screens.

Some of my code can be found on most Linux machines. If you are using a
desktop Linux system, you might consider executing `man 1 unshare` and
referring to the `AUTHORS` section.

### Technical leadership

I have experience in introducing, setting up and fine-tuning software
development, testing, and deployment processes. I established engineering
processes for code review, continuous integration, and unit and acceptance
testing in Ridge, CFEngine and OpenInkpot.

### Product management

At Ridge, I have defined product requirements based on customers needs,
aiming to make the product appealing to various roles within our customers'
organizations.

In OpenInkpot, I determined the product scope, gathered information about
customer needs, and translated them into specific product requirements.

### Project management

I have managed small, volunteer-based teams, including the the distributed team
responsible for producing software for the Azbooka e-reader of the OpenInkpot
project.
