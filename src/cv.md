## Professional Summary

I am an experienced technical leader in the field of software engineering, with deep
expertise in the following areas:
- setting up full cycle development process, from requirements gathering to operations,
- providing technical guidance/governance,
- managing organizational and technical complexity.

My background is in software engineering, and I keep my engineering
skills sharp: I am constantly involved in designing, maintaining,
and operating software systems with an emphasis on long-term maintainability.

I'm open to both contract and full-time opportunities.

## Professional Experience

## [Ridge](https://ridge.co) (2018—Present)

Head of Engineering.

Ridge developed and operates a distributed IaaS/PaaS cloud:
- Workloads run across hundreds of globally dispersed data centers,
- A new data center can be added to the system within minutes to hours,
- IaaS offers computing workloads, network isolation, IP management, load balancing and persistent storage.
- PaaS offers managed Kubernetes, managed containers and managed object storage.

My roles comprised software architect, technical leader and software engineer.

Key achievments:
- Devised a unique software architecture, reducing the project's complexity and negating the need for a large team to deliver full functionality in a timely manner.
- Introduced and optimised design, development, testing and operational processes to utilize our limited resources optimally.
- Oversaw the design and mentored the team.
- Implemented a significant portion of the system.

Consequently, a compact engineering team, 10 engineers on average, could rapidly deliver the required functionality.
