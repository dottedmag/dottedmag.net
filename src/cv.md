## Summary

I design, develop, maintain and run software systems with a focus on long-term
maintainability, and lead small teams doing so.

## Software design, development & operations

In Ridge I produce software architecture, component design and supporting tools
and procedures. I also implement a quite a bit of the design.

In Luminati I have designed and implemented application-devel metrics and
logging system, providing visibility into the application behaviour, and
created an application-specific database system to eliminate the bottleneck
that could not be solved by off-the-shelf database.

In OpenInkpot I have designed and guided the effort to develop embedded
Linux distribution suited for eBook readers, from kernel up to custom
UI optimized for e-Ink screens.

Outside of commercial context I am a contributor to [numerous open source
projects](https://dottedmag.net/software/), including well-known ones such
as BusyBox, fontconfig, GNOME, Linux and VLC. Some of my code is present on
most Linux machines: if you're on desktop Linux, you might want to run
`man 1 unshare` and check `AUTHORS` section.

## Technical leadership

I know how to introduce, set up and fine tune processes of software development,
testing and deployment. In Ridge, CFEngine and OpenInkpot I have established
engineering processes of code review, continuous integration and unit- and
acceptance-testing.

## Product management

In Ridge I define product requirements based on collected customers' needs
to make the product appealing to all roles in customers' organizations.

In OpenInkpot I defined the product scope, collected customers' needs and
translated them into product requirements.

## Project management

I have some experience managing small teams, especially volunteer-based: In OpenInkpot
I managed volunteer contributors and a distributed team to produce software for
Azbooka e-reader.

# What do I expect?

Remote work and a flexible work schedule, to a reasonable extent.

# Projects/Companies

## [Ridge](https://ridge.co) (2018+)

Software architect.

I'm responsible for creating product requirements, software architecture,
internal tools and development procedures.

## [Hola!](https://hola.org) / [Luminati](https://luminati.io) (2013-2018)

Senior software engineer.

I have improved insight into performance of Hola services by adding
- centralised application-level logging, and
- application-level metrics

that made it much easier to pinpoint and resolve performance problems and bugs.

I have created several internal-facing statistic dashboards for Hola VPN and
also user-facing statistics for Hola Spark CDN.

While working on Luminati I have implemented a custom in-memory DB to track the
status of 1M+ peers of Luminati network that decreased the price of hardware
running this database by 8x compared to the off-the-shelf DB.

## [CFEngine](https://cfengine.com) (2011-2013)

Senior software engineer.

## [OpenInkpot](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Openinkpot) (2007-2012)

Founder, software developer, product manager, project manager.

A Linux distribution for eBook readers. I have started it, have built the
infrastructure (from bugtracking to cross-compiling Debian packages in
CI environment to repository manager) and have implemented lot of low-level code.

## [Parallels](https://parallels.com) (2004-2007)

* Software engineer in Plesk for Unix. I have created a tool for transferring contents
of competing hosting panels to Plesk, which was then repurposed as a backup system.

* Software architect in OpenFusion. I have designed SSO mechanism for Parallels apps, and also
a [Web applications packaging format](http://www.apsstandard.org/)
([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Packaging_Standard)).
