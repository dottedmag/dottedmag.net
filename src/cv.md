## Professional Summary

I am a software engineer specializing in designing, developing,
maintaining and running software systems with a focus on long-term
maintainability. I have experience leading small teams and possess
strong technical leadership and product management skills. I am an
an contributor to numerous open-source projects, including
well-known ones such as BusyBox, fontconfig, GNOME, Linux, and VLC.

## Areas of Expertise

### Software design, Development & Operations

At Ridge, I have been responsible for software architecture,
component design and the development of supporting tools
and procedures. Additionally, I have implemented a significant portion
of the system.

At Luminati, I designed and implemented an application-level metrics and
logging system to enhance visibility into the application behavior, and
created a custom database system to overcome a performance bottleneck
that could not be resolved by using off-the-shelf databases.

In the OpenInkpot project, I guided the development of an embedded
Linux distribution tailored for eBook readers, spanning from the kernel
up to custom UI optimized for e-Ink screens.

Some of my code can be found on most Linux machines. If you are using a
desktop Linux system, you may want to execute `man 1 unshare` and refer
to the `AUTHORS` section.

### Technical leadership

I have experience in introducing, setting up and fine-tuning software
development, testing, deployment processes. In Ridge, CFEngine and OpenInkpot,
I established engineering processes for code review, continuous integration,
and unit and acceptance testing.

### Product management

At Ridge, I have defined product requirements based on customers needs
to make the product appealing to various roles within customers organizations.

In OpenInkpot, I determined the product scope, gathered customer needs and
translated them into product requirements.

### Project management

I have managed small, volunteer-based teams, such as the distributed team
responsible for producing software for the Azbooka e-reader in the OpenInkpot
project.

## Work preferences

I am seeking remote work with a reasonably flexible schedule.
