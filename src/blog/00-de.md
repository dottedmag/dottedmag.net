title: DE/compositor development notes - introduction
date: 2023-07-05
----
This is a set of blog posts about implementation of a [new desktop environment](/new-de/).

The posts are not meant to be the exhaustive documentation of the topics raised.
They are working notes for me to ensure I understand the topics well enough.

I limit the scope of the posts in the following way:
- I only describe Linux. I am not interested in portability at this point.
- I only describe _modern_ Linux. Historical information is demoted to footnotes,
  and I won't spend time explaining how historical interfaces work if they are
  fully replaced by modern ones.
- I only describe desktop/laptop environment. The DE in progress does not try to
  scretch itself to cover embedded, handhelds and other environments.
- I only describe modern hardware. The main platform for the DE is Apple M1/M2,
  the secondary platform is modern PC with Intel graphics card. I won't talk about
  big-endian processors, exotic buses and compositing without a GPU.

The posts will be updated over time as I expand and correct them.
